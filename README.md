## NLP - Scraping GitHub for Programming Languages
##### By Fred & Misty - Super Fantastic Team 

scraping data from GitHub repository README files. The goal will be to build a model that can predict what programming language a repository is, given the text of the README file.


### Contents:

#### Jupyter Notebook    nlp-project.ipynb
Notebook that thoroughly demonstrates the steps involved in performing analysis on the provided data.

#### Python Modules      acquire, prepare, explore, model
Modules containing the functions that are used in the Notebook.

#### Data                data_final.json, URL_list_100_final.csv
JSON file with the contents of each readme, the language Github has labelled for each repo, and their URL

#### Environment         environment.yml
A file that explicitly lists the python modules required to use this repository.

#### Prediction Model    decision_tree_classifier.sav
A pickle file that stores a the machine learning algorithm fitted to the training data used in the analysis.

#### Data Dictionary     data_dict.txt
Definitions of each of the data fields used.
